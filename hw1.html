    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4 style="font-family:Times New Roman">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Start a pot of well salted water to a boil. Boil the pasta until (start tasting a few minutes before the package recommends:you want it to be tender but still a little firm on the inside; usually around 7 to 8 minutes). Drain.</b></li>
            <li>Meanwhile, measure out all ingredients in advance; the cooking process happens fast!</li>
            <li>Right after you add the pasta to the pot, start the sauce: In a small or medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.Add the grated garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and whisk constantly for 1 minute to 90 seconds, until bubbly and golden. Do not overcook it: the flour can turn brown within a few seconds. Keep an eye on it!</li>
            <li>Add a splash of milk and whisk it in: the sauce will instantly turn chunky. Constantly whisking, continue to add splashes of milk and whisk them in until the entire quantity is incorporated and the sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and whisk until the sauce thickens and no longer tastes like raw flour, about 5 minutes. Add the salt and Parmesan cheese. Taste and add a pinch or two more salt if desired.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, then add the sauce. Add a splash or two of milk to loosen the sauce and stir until you have the right consistency.Taste and a few more pinches of salt, if necessary. (The sauce is best freshly made, so we don’t recommend making it in advance).Serve with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
